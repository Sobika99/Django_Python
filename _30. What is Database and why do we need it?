DB types:
1. Relational 
  . Structured data , example : spreedsheet, excel
  - EX: myqsl, sql server, oracle db
  - stores data in rows and columns called schema

2. Non-relational
  - non structured
  - used when we need flexibility
  

Primary Key: 
  - stores information as json string
  - ex: ecommerce - stores information of customer : every customer identified by unique key! If two customers with same name but customer id is varied. Which means primary key
  - ex: john need to update city db. Multiple people can have name "john", so primary key is helpful here. With the use of primary key we can update city
  - Data not corrupted
  
Foreign key :
   - repeated information can be stored in DB.
   - example: one single customer orders couple of items
   - So create seperate order table and link to customer table
   - redudancy decreased
   - Here "order_id: is primary key. "Customer_id" in the 'orders" table is meant as foreign key
   
Linking customer and order known as "Relationships"
Method of eliminating / removing redundant data freom DB known as " Normalization"

Manipulation:
  - SQL : Structured Qurey language
  - Select, Insert, Delete , update, Drop are some commands used in relational DB.
